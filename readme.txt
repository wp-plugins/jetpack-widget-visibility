Control what pages your widgets appear on.

== Description ==

Jetpack Widget Visibility adds a new button to every widget in the widget area, allowing you to choose on which page this particular widget appears. or disappears.  
It's very easy to add conditions and the conditions are flexibile enough to give you great control over you widgets visibility.

Visibility is controlled by five aspects: page type, category, tag, date, and author.  
For example, if you wanted the Archives widget to only appear on category archives and error pages, choose “Show” from the first dropdown and then add two rules: “Page is 404 Error Page” and “Category is All Category Pages.”

You can also hide widgets based on the current page.  
For example, if you don’t want the Archives widget to appear on search results pages, choose “Hide” and “Page is Search Results.”

= Notes =

[Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) is a plugin that ships with many modules. Why install the whole package, if you're just interested in one module?!

This plugin is the exact [Widget Visibility module](http://jetpack.me/support/widget-visibility/) of the original Jetpack plugin, only without all the extra stuff.

The version number of this plugin will follow the version number of Jetpack. This way, it's easier for you to know which Jetpack version this module was extracted from.

Things you'd be happy to know:

* The module is almost untouched. (Some lines had to be removed and some had to be added, for the sole reason of making the module a stand-alone plugin).
* The module was carefully extracted from the package. That means there is no missing feature or some irrelevant code.
* The module does not require a connection to a WordPress.com account.

Note: Translations was not included, due to the fact that Jetpack uses one transaltion file for all the modules, which makes it really difficult to extract translations.
The good news is that the module can be translated easily.
